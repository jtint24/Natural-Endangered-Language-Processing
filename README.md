# Natural-Endangered-Language-Processing

**Broad Mission Statement**: 

Develop tools to aid in the development of core Natural Language Processing algorithms for endangered languages.

**Terms of Success**:

* Reduce supervision and effort required to generate core NLP algorithms for arbitrary endangered languages
  * Core NLP algorithms may include
    * Part of Speech Taggers
    * Lemmatizers
    * Stemmers
* “Reducing supervision and effort” entails
  * Reducing the amount of linguistics/CS knowledge required to create core NLP algorithms
  * Reducing amount of time required to create said algorithms
  * Reducing human input; relying more on unsupervised or low-supervised learning to create NLP algorithms
  * Reduce effort required to actually obtain the NLP metatool
  * Prove efficacy of NLP algorithm generation method
  * This may entail:
    * Apply method to particular languages and test generated tools
    * Demonstrating broad scope of algorithm generation method
